It is a bit outside of Barcelona, so you need a car to get there. That makes it a bit more expensive and less spontaneous. But the place itself is beautiful. It is an old villa with a lot of character. The building has a nice outside area, including a pool, but since we went on a cold day, the pool was closed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, the architecture looked very good. On the ground floor there is a social area with a nice bar. There is also a small shop at the entrance where you can buy some toys and gadgets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That evening, the club was not very full. Maybe around 10 couples, some playing, but nothing very exciting. Still, not bad for a random night. Sadly, there were some electricity problems. At one point, the lights and music stopped completely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our feeling is: this club has a lot of potential. The building is really beautiful and unique. If it\u2019s full and everything works, it could be a great place. But on our evening, it was quiet. So this is a limited review \u2014 not bad, but we hope to come again on a better night.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our review &amp; story: We went to this club on a random evening.
